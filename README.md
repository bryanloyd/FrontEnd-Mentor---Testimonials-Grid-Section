## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

### Continued development

I will continue to work on this project because I have been unable to have the mobile view to diplay correctly. The top 25% does not display on the mobile view. I think that it has to do with the display port reference line.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://grid.malven.co/) - This helped me with setting up the grids for this project.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - Trusty MDN comes through to remind of the various <background> properties.
